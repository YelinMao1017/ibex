# Note : SDF is an IEEE standard for the representation and interpretation of timing data
#        The SDF file includes delays (module path, device, interconnect, and port), timing checks (setup, hold, recovery, skew, width, and period),
#        timing constraints (path and skew), incremental and absolute delays, and so on
write_sdf "${top_level}.syn.sdf"
Information: Annotated 'cell' delays are assumed to include load delay. (UID-282)
Information: Writing timing information to file '/homes/user/stud/fall23/yl5334/ibex_/ibex/dc_syn/dc/ibex/ibex_top.syn.sdf'. (WT-3)
