*info: 1368 no-driver nets excluded.
**WARN: (IMPECO-560):	The netlist is not unique, because the module 'prim_generic_buf_s00000020' is instantiated multiple times. Make the netlist unique by running 'set init_design_uniquify 1' before loading the design to avoid the problem.
Type 'man IMPECO-560' for more detail.
**WARN: (IMPOPT-3213):	The netlist contains multi-instanciated modules. The optimization engine will consider these modules as dont touch. Uniquify the netlist to get better quality of results.
Type 'man IMPOPT-3213' for more detail.

*info: there are 9 max_cap violations in the design.
*info: 1 violation is real (remark R).
*info: 8 violations may not be fixable:

 *** Starting Verify Geometry (MEM: 3164.5) ***

**WARN: (IMPVFG-257):	setVerifyGeometryMode/verifyGeometry command is obsolete and should not be used any more. It still works in this release but will be removed in future release. You should change to use set_verify_drc_mode/verify_drc which is the replacement tool for verifyGeometry.
